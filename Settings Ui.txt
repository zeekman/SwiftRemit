I’ve got you. Here is the breakdown of your work on the Swift Remit Settings UI, written in the first person to highlight your specific contributions to the design and functionality.

My Work: Swift Remit Settings Interface
I designed the Settings UI for Swift Remit, a high-performance micro-remittance platform built on the Stellar network. My goal was to take complex Web3 identity and security features and package them into a clean, fintech-first mobile experience.

Core UI/UX Contributions
Identity & Network Architecture: I established a clear hierarchy for user data, separating personal identity from blockchain-specific details. I integrated a "copy-to-clipboard" function for the Stellar Public Key to ensure long-form addresses are easily manageable.

Automated Philanthropy Logic: I designed the "Auto-donate round-ups" module, a key feature that allows users to seamlessly contribute spare change from their transactions to selected causes.

Asset Management: I built the Currency Selector component to allow for rapid switching between XLM and other micro-remittance assets, ensuring the UI remains intuitive for non-technical users.

High-Stakes Security UI: I developed the "Advanced Security" notification system. By using a distinct red-bordered card and shield icon, I made it clear that Multi-sig is active and that core settings require secondary approval.

Network Transparency: I included a persistent "Always-Synced" footer with the specific node version (Precision Node 0.4.2), providing technical users with real-time confidence in the app’s connectivity.

Visual Language
Dark Mode Optimization: I utilized a deep obsidian and plum palette to create a "Pro" feel that reduces eye strain while maintaining a high-tech, Web3 aesthetic.

State Indicators: I implemented high-contrast "Live" and "Active" status badges to give users immediate visual feedback on their account and network standing.
