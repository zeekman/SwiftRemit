Project: Swift Remit — Decentralized Finance Interface
The Design Vision
I designed the Swift Remit landing page to bridge the gap between complex blockchain protocols and an intuitive user experience. The goal was to create a "Trust-First" visual language that balances high-performance technology with community-driven governance.

Key UI Features I Developed:
The Security & Privacy Control Center: I conceptualized a centralized dashboard that gives users granular control over their digital footprint, featuring custom-designed toggles for Biometric Locks and Stealth Mode.

Real-time Activity Log: Designed a high-density data table that maintains readability while tracking live mainnet events, successful logins, and API rotations.

Ecosystem Pillar Cards: Created a modular "Pillar" system to highlight the core strengths of the protocol—Security, Modern Tech, and Community Leadership—using a consistent iconography and grid system.

Performance Metrics: Integrated a sleek footer data-strip to visualize $4.2B+ in protected assets and 0.0ms settlement delay, reinforcing the platform's reliability.

Technical Execution
Visual Style: Deep-space dark mode with a primary "Electric Violet" accent to signify innovation and premium security.

Typography & Hierarchy: Leveraged bold, high-contrast headings to guide the user from the "Future of Finance" value proposition down to the Discord community conversion point.
